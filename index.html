<h1>ArdenWARE OS</h1>
<p>This is an OS that may be installed on many devices. It does this by modifing system files while the OS is running to produce a flavor! Shares emulation with the ArdenWARE OS (Thorium) Project (AWOT-P) by using Emulation Thor (with pre-modified data to execute) which compiles .ethor files. A full installation may not be used by the ArdenWARE Flavor Installation Program (AWFIP) and are more stable/common than AWFIP installations. We amy not be able to provide help with your flavor, but if Emulation Thor is working you can type "helper" in the command prompt.</p>
<p>Thanks for installing!</p>
