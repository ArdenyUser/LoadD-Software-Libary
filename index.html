<h1>VISIX Project</h1>
<p>We are proud to annouce the Visix project, a compiler to change OS developement! Also it has plenty other uses. Visix works like this:</p>
<p><em><strong>Code &gt; Converts to ASM or C# &gt; Compiles</strong></em></p>
<p>.VIS stands for: Vision Involved Scripting.</p>
<p>ALSO, we call the system Visix uses to <strong>Uncompilable Script</strong><strong> to Compilable Script</strong> (USCS)<strong> Compiler</strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>These USCS compilers are easier to make, and easy to use! Please wait until the beta is released!</p>
<p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New: 2/19/2022 - FunScr Updates</h2>
<p>FunScr is found in our official repository, the V-funscr and funscr CORE are great ways to make functions for Visix and V-like langueges. BUT, it edits the source code which is&nbsp;<strong>not very efficient and we do nto want it.&nbsp;</strong>We will close development on funscr and soon cut it.&nbsp;<strong><em>So PLEASE use the Windows subsitute of funscr, VLIB Script.</em></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for understanding,</p>
<p>VISIX Developers</p>
