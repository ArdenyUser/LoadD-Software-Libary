APP MAKE INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

First, to generate app, create a APPMAKE file. Next, add repeated code scripts
that are like this:

[elf file to link to]
[app file name]
...

Then, you made a APPMAKE file! To make more configs, list more of the scripts above.
Remember yo replace the things in the []s! Also, you can make a app run more than
1 elf you can make more than 1 configuration for each file. Now, how do you
run a APPMAKE file? Well first go copy & paste (do this sentence if your project is
not a template) the elfexepreferences.sh file into the folder with the
APPMAKE file. (do this even if your project is a template -->) Now, edit the file
you just pasted and edit the part that looks like this:

elfexecute () {
   [function to execute elf] $1
}

Edit the []s depending on what system your apps are running on. (the elf
exepreferences file needs to be in every dir with a APPMAKE file.) And, getting close
to finished, copy and paste the elfexecuter.sh to your programs's main dir if it is
not already there. Then, in the same dir as the elfexecuter.sh file, add a
appexecute file and add a list of the APP files. Now, wanna make an app? To
execute the APPMAKE file, copy and paste appmake.py to the same dir
as the programs if it is not already there. Execute it and your app is
compiled. NOTICE: appexecute conatins names of .app files! Add the extensions!
